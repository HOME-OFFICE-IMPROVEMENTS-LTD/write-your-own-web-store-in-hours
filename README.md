# Write Your Own Web Store In Hours

This project is the basis of [Ben Dechrai](https://bendechrai.com/)'s workshop by the same name.

> By the end of this workshop, you will have created a React-based Single Page Application that allows customers to log in using Auth0, and can list and purchase a number of products based on the product catalogue defined in your Stripe account.
